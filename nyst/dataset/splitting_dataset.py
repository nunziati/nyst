# Function to filter data based on patients
def filter_data_by_patients(data, selected_patients):
    '''
    This function creates a boolean mask to identify which data samples belong to the selected patients and
    returns a new DataFrame containing only the data from those patients.

    Arguments:
    - data (DataFrame): A DataFrame containing the dataset, including a 'video' column with patient IDs.
    - selected_patients (array-like): A list or array of patient IDs that should be used to filter the data.

    Returns:
    - filtered_data (DataFrame): A DataFrame containing only the data samples that correspond to the selected patients.

# Function to split the data into training and test sets
def split_data(file_path, perc_test=0.1):
    '''
    Splits the input dataset into training and test sets while ensuring that each patientâ€™s data is entirely in one set.

    The function separates the dataset by patients, ensuring no common data occurs between training and test sets, 
    shuffles the patients, and splits the data based on the given test set percentage. Then, it shuffles the data 
    clips within the training and test sets for randomness.

    Arguments:
    - file_path (str): The path to the CSV file containing the dataset.
    - perc_test (float): The percentage of the total data to include in the test set (default is 0.1, or 10%).

    Returns:
    - None: The function saves the training and test sets to 'train_label.csv' and 'test_label.csv' respectively.
